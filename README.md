## Preparing for development

Before you begin development, make sure to prepare the .env file with the following contents:

```ini
TZ=Asia/Tokyo
GITHUB_GRAPHQL_TOKEN="GitHub Token"
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID="Google Analytics ID"
```

You need to run `prebuild` because you need to pre-build the markdown files.

```
npm run prebuild
```

However, if you have run `npm run build` beforehand, you do not need to run `npm run prebuild`.

### Development

```
npm run dev
```

### Production build

To execute the Next.js build for production, run the following command:
